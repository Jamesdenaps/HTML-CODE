  <h1>Derrick Rose ACL Tear</h1>
  
  <p>The Derrick Rose ACL tear refers to an injury suffered by NBA player Derrick Rose, a former MVP of the league. Rose tore the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his left knee during a playoff game on April 28, 2012, while playing for the Chicago Bulls.</p>
  
  <p>The injury occurred late in the game when Rose attempted to jump to make a pass. Upon landing, he collapsed in pain, clutching his knee. The severity of the injury was immediately apparent, and Rose was subsequently sidelined for the remainder of the playoffs.</p>
  
  <p>The ACL tear was a devastating blow to Rose and the Bulls organization. Rose was forced to undergo surgery to repair the ligament and faced a lengthy rehabilitation process. He missed the entire 2012-2013 NBA season as he worked to regain strength and mobility in his knee.</p>
  
  <p>Despite his best efforts to return to form, Rose's career has been plagued by injuries, including additional knee surgeries and setbacks. While he has shown flashes of his former brilliance at times, he has struggled to consistently perform at the elite level he once did.</p>
  
  <p>The Derrick Rose ACL tear serves as a reminder of the fragility of professional athletes' careers and the challenges they face in overcoming injuries. It also underscores the importance of proper rehabilitation and injury prevention in sports.</p>
